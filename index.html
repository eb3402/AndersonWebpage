												<p><i>Dr. Anderson is true to his field of science and he is dedicated to his students. When I completed my doctoral work he continued to encourage me and my creativity in the field of science and I thank him tremendously. Dr. Anderson also gave me permission to use  one of the labs at TC, to continue developing experiments for the laboratory manual that my colleague and I wrote for the Bergen Community College nursing students in microbiology, and my own research. I will forever be grateful for his kindness. I must say that it is truly an honor to know such an astounding professor and scientist.</i>

                        <p><i>I took the Quantitative Research Methods course with Dr. O. Roger Anderson and he was always ready to help you. I have often visited him in Zoom sessions to discuss our class assignments and the final project. I have also taken the Research and Independent study in science education this past summer and he is very humble and helps you by looking up literature that adds to your literature review and instruments used. I have learned so much from him that I am also continuing to take the same course this semester, fall 2022. I encourage everyone to take these two courses that I have. His knowledge in the Quantitative Research Methods course and the Research and Independent study is vast and contains interdisciplinary information and experiences. I am grateful that I had a chance to know such a rare, caring, and expertise across many areas of learning. He provides a community and collaborative environment in the Zoom classroom. He is a special professor and human being. I am very glad to learn from him not only content knowledge but integrity and humanity. Thank you for being a great example of humanness.</i>
                          <br>
                          <strong>– Helen Park</strong>
												</p>
                        	<p><i>Professor Anderson is a great professor and teacher. I learned a great deal from his teaching methods. He is thoughtful and kind in his approach and I appreciate the valuable time he took out to help me in his course. Thank you professor Anderson and congratulations on your achievement!</i>

												</p>
                        <p><i>Dr. Anderson’s way of being occurs to me as “service to all doctoral students.” Dr. Anderson made time - as much time as was needed - to help you grasp statistical concepts or a quant research method. He works with you until you get that which was stumping you and explains concepts better than what can come out of a textbook. Teaching IS his calling.</i>
                          <br>
                          <strong>– Yvonne Thevenot</strong>
                        <p><i>I will never forget when I first met Roger as part of my campus visit. He had read my work (on Internet art, no less — a topic so different from his area of study!) with such care and thoughtfulness, and asked such insightful questions, that he made me see my own research in a new and valuable light. This small moment is emblematic of the kindness, openness and intellectual generosity that characterizes Roger as a scholar and mentor. Through his vision and leadership, Roger has shaped the MST department into the warm, collegial, energizing environment that it is today. He truly embodies what generosity in academia can look like, and we are all better because of it.</i>
                          <br>
                          <strong>– Ioana Literat</strong>
												</p>
                         <p><i>It has been my absolute pleasure to know you these years at TC.  I feel so fortunate to have learned from you as Department Chair, as teacher, and as scholar.  Thank you for your kindness and care and I wish you every possible happiness.</i>
                           <br>
                           <strong>–Katie Embree</strong>
												</p>
                        <p><i>Professor O. Roger Anderson represents the very best of academia – one of those people who reminds you of why you went into this business, a person you feel so privileged to know, someone with an understated humor and an outsize generosity of spirit.  He trusted me to help create a series of science education workshops at TC, provided me with an opportunity to teach as a member of the adjunct faculty in TC’s science education program and gently coaxed me into becoming an officer of Columbia’s Sigma Xi honor society.  After I had moved professionally from TC to the American Museum of Natural History, he successfully encouraged the Museum’s collaboration in an NSF-funded climate change education project, for which the prime benefit for me was his presence as a collaborator.  (And when he would travel from TC to AMNH, he inevitably walked the forty blocks.)  I am so grateful for his gentle leadership, his trust and his moral compass that points true north.  I thank him for all of it and wish him, with great fondness, all good things in life.</i>
                          <br>
                          <strong>–Dr. Robert Steiner</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p><i>Dr. Anderson's teaching has significantly impacted my research approach to quantitative study, critical quantitative study, and science education. From the readings to the activities and final project, Dr. Anderson's experience was monumental in addressing knowledge gaps and drawing connections to wide areas of practical application. Thank you Dr. Anderson for a thoughtful, engaging, and enjoyable Quantitative Research Methodology course.</i>
                          <br>
                          <strong>–Shane Coleman</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p><i>When I think of Roger, the words "kindness," "decency" and "selflessness" spring to mind. He is the kind of person who, when asked for help, finds a way to give it -- and if he sees that help is needed, gives it unasked and without fanfare. He cares about the institution -- not just the machine, but the individuals who constitute it. And in the years I worked in communications at TC, he never once focused attention on his own extensive accomplishments as a both a scientist and an educator, instead reaching out only to promote the accomplishments of colleagues, students and alumni. Very few people, in any capacity, are truly irreplaceable. Roger is.
