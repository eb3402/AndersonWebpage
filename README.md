## About Prof. Anderson

He is a prolific researcher and author on the natural sciences, including on the topics of microbial physiological ecology, oceanography, climate change, and aquatic and terrestrial dynamics.

## Designers and Developers

This was originally designed and developed by Priscilla Cancar, as well as COGMOS Team members Yuke We, Zoe Yuan, Marcus Cheung, and Qiyao Fan.

Ethan Bookstein has since adopted the formatting of the webpage (years later) in order to reflect many of Professor Anderson's accomplishments and legacy, while also showcasing some custom styling and other additional features.
